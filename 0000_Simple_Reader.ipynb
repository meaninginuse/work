        "\n",
        "\"I took him at his word that this was an isolated incident. Since then, there have been numerous reports of other incidents, allegations, so in that respect I've asked Tony to resign from caucus so that he can respond to these allegations,\" Scheer said.\n",

        "\n",
        "Scheer said he was made aware of an RCMP investigation into the alleged extortion last week and then subsequently met with Clement face-to-face on Monday, when he was \"brought up to speed about what was going on.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "It was then mutually decided, Scheer said, that Clement should resign his justice critic role and positions on a number of Commons committees — including a top secret national security and intelligence committee.\n",

        "Opposition Leader Andrew Scheer spoke to reporters as he arrived for his weekly Caucus meeting. His Justice Critic Tony Clement resigned last night after being the alleged victim of a blackmail attempt. 2:22\n",
        "Parliamentarians on this committee — MPs and senators alike — are privy to the nation's most guarded secrets as they review the work of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), the Communications Security Establishment, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Canada Border Services Agency.\n",

The precise timeline of events was not immediately clear.\n",

        "\n",
        "\"I don't have anything further to add to that dynamic, or to anything about … internal caucus matters, but I think we can all agree that this was a very poor decision,\" he told reporters Wednesday.\n",
